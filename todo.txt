Revision 2: (Following Space Ryde Guidelines) April 2022 - TBD
==============================================================================
Summary:    - Some visualization
            - Follows guidelines (nothing more)
            - Doesn't implement RTOS, but uses RTOS model?
            - Tries to use multithreading.
            - Planes can fly at all sorts of angles (not realistic).
            - Planes fly at a constant speed the entire time
            - All planes fly at the same altitude (2d view, no queueing on top of each other).
            - maybe we try using proper lat/lon in degrees -> need -90 to +90
            - note that heading in radians? -> why radians

System Design
---------------------------
- Plane Class - contains each plane and allows it to function independently.
              - Shouts if airspace is violated (safe distance limit violated). -> might be super costly to check?
                                                                                  (add as build flag?)
              - Is a state machine?: - contact tower
                                     - fly path
                                     - hold
                                     - land
                                     - return position
                                     - return intent (ie emergencies? if we make)

- Tower Class - Is our "controller"
              - Contains multiple states/threads: - accept plane    -> interrupt to add a plane to queue
                                                  - queue landing(s)-> updates our queue
                                                        - shuffles planes to which runway they should be landing on
                                                        - does not handle last plane.
                                                  - land plane      -> if plane is close and next, land
                                                        - creates a no-fly zone with landing path.
                                                  - generate paths  -> gives planes instructions.
                                                        - generates paths CONSTANTLY to avoid collisions & max space

- Airfield Class - Designs our airfield.

- Watchman class - Is the "god" of our project.
    - generates planes (randomly)
    - creates random accidents/emergencies (maybe)
    - runs in own thread

- Vizualizer - Is the display for our thing
    - runs in own thread. (constant speed -> hopefully).

Visualization:
---------------------------
- Pygame?
- run in seperate thread at steady rate?
- have different views
    - allow us to zoom in an follow one specific plane -> show list of planes on the side that we can click to
    - allow us to see the whole map?                   -> Show map in the corner always, clicking on it brings it up
- draw planes                                           > might just be points.
- draw thin radius around planes (show safe distance)   > thin white? << might not even be visible
- draw radius of controller                             > outlined in thicker white?
- draw runways?                                         > outlined in thicker white?
- draw predicted paths?                                 > red/orange - long dashed?

Path Generation
---------------------------
- Take next <num_runways> of planes and queue them to nearest runway
- Queue next number of planes to have most efficient path to runway?
    > the idea here is to minimise the amount of time spent in a holding pattern.
    - take into account which runway is closest // how many planes are queue'd at each entrance/exit...
        - Find runway opening that has the least number of "next" planes? (make an "educated guess?")
            > but this might not even get assigned until later...
    > could use a greedy algorithm, queue all planes towards "holding zone" near runway, and de-queue as necessary?
        (either to land or to put in a different location).

Revision 1: (Following Space Ryde Guidelines) January 2022 - February 2022
==============================================================================
- basic queue system.
- assigned slots
- no visualization
